<h2 id="document-purpose">Document Purpose</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the document is to specify the requirements of the Identity Management and Trust Subcomponent "Cloud Personal Credential Manager" with the intention of a European wide public tender for implementing this software. Main audience for this document is attendees of the public tender, which are able to supply an open-source software solution for the area of identity and document verification with the purpose to provide a credential manager application to be used by natural people to participate in the Gaia-X trust structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="product-scope">Product Scope</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of these products is to provide all necessary components for the self-sovereign administration of the digital identity of a principal in the Gaia-X context. The Cloud Personal Credential Manager enables a natural person to act as a <em>principal</em> of an organization within the SSI-based Gaia-X ecosystem in a privacy-preserving, trustful and secure way from a computer browser. This comprises the following main functionalities:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remote Management of a Cloud Wallet or multiple Wallets which are connected to the cPCM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reception and management of verifiable credentials from other parties (e.g., a principal credential from a Gaia-X participant) by using the web frontend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presenting Verifiable Presentations to other parties in an automated or manual manner by using plugins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure storage and management of respective secrets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consent Management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy Based Decisions about Issuing/Presentations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plugin System which extends the Holder Capabilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The Cloud Personal Credential Manager(cPCM) must be implemented as a cloud component which provides the end user a web front- end for managing the connected OCM [IDM.OCM], OCM W-Stack [IDM.OCM.W-STACK] and TSA [TSA] by providing an integration layer for various use cases of Holders.</p>
<p>In general, the cPCM acts as an integration layer between OCM, OCM W-Stack and TSA to orchestrate for the user various use cases by using plugins e.g., "ID Card Proof Plugin" which provides the function "Automatically prove that you own a valid id card".</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/image2.png" /></p>
<p>It's strictly required to use OCM, OCM W-Stack and TSA for this purpose. Building a new agent and reimplementing protocols like aries is not foreseen here! cPCM acts strictly as an integration layer, with a connection to the PCM and must provide just a REST API. All SSI related protocols must be realized over OCM and OCM W-Stack.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the necessary tools to operate and maintain the created software components in an enterprise environment with focus on high-availability, security, monitoring, and logging based on common standards. Documentation for developer, operator and user MUST be written in markdown format and have to be published in the provided public repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/image2.png" /></p>
<p>If it's required to do code restructurings, modifying the current solution by adding new microservices etc. then this is explicitly allowed.</p>
<p>Please note, that it is explicitly required to deliver the software up and running. Responsibility for existing code cannot be shifted to previous development teams.</p>

<h2 id="product-functions">Product Functions</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Cloud PCM acts as an integration layer for the OCM, OCM W-Stack and TSA to support an end user for handling his/her credentials in the cloud. This means from a functional perspective that all features must be securely remotely controllable by the WEB UI or by the PCM app. This requires the establishment of a secure web socket channel between the PCM App/Web UI and the Cloud PCM by developing pairing mechanisms on SSI basis. In general, the cPCM receives commands over the web socket channel and orchestrates the work in the background by utilizing the OCM/OCM W-Stack and the TSA to provide a value add for the end user. The end user doesn\'t care about credential formats or connections, so the cPCM must be able to provide an UX which hides all agent information from the user by providing core functions and plugin-based extensions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In detail <strong>the front-end layer</strong> is comprised of the following features and components:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>End User Authentication: component provides for the implementation of secure user authentication policies which can include but are not limited to PIN, password, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graphical User Interface (GUI): enables end users to interact with the cPCM and use the cPCM functions.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cpcm-core">cPCM Core</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The cPCM Core (Wallet) layer</strong> consists of the following features and components:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing Connections (where applicable)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Settings Configuration (Personalization)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing Credentials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wallet Backup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credential Wallet Importing/Exporting</p>

<li>
<p>Secret Storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plugin System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consent Management</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Managing Connections</em> service within the backend establishes the connection with the communication entities outside cPCM (such as a Service Provider or a Credentials Issuer) by using the OCM provided REST APIs. For instance, after receiving the bootstrapping request from the <em>Local Input Interfaces</em> in the <em>Frontend</em>.</p>
<p><em>App Settings Configuration</em> abstracts the implementation of possible personalization properties that tailor the respective cPCM instance to the needs and requirements of a specific end user.</p>
<p>The <em>Managing Credentials</em> feature provides the functionality for managing credentials in the UI, receiving credentials issued by other participants, enabling the user to view and inspect his/her credentials, and the basic functionality for providing credential attributes to other participants according to the SSI paradigm. The credential manager ensures that the user is always in control, which credentials with which content is presented and issued, and which credentials from which party were received. This includes the UI visualization, notifications and as well the orchestration between different components as OCM(s), TSA and PCM mobile.</p>
<p>The <em>Wallet Backup</em> feature provides a secure backup for the received credentials on the smartphone. A web socket function realizes the secure transfer of backup files of the PCM App to the cPCM backend.</p>
<p>The <em>Credential Wallet Importing/Exporting</em> feature allows to securely export the credentials from cPCM or PCM, and to import the credentials into other PCM or cPCM. Through this, the so-called cross-wallet compatibility can be ensured in future (that is, the compatibility between different implementations of PCM that share the same standard for credentials definition and management). It should be also possible to store created PCM backups versioned into the cPCM for later usage and restore functionality. This feature is just applicable for W3C credentials [W3C]. Aries credentials are out of scope.</p>
<p><em>Secret storage</em> provides for secure persistent storage of the backuped credentials and files. A separate key management handles the user generate secrets such as private keys or seeds to use it later for the generation of JWT tokens, requesting or issuing credentials by utilizing the connected OCMs.</p>
<p>The plugin system provides the capability to develop and enable new plugins for the cPCM, which can interact with the orchestration flow of the linked TSA and the OCMs. This MUST be realized over an eventing pattern which allows developers to integrate their processes into the raised events.</p>
<p><em>Consent Management</em> provides an additional plugin event pattern which observes presentations and issues requests to the underlying OCM(s) which are handled then type by type over a consent plugin. For each type, the plugin executes a flow which forces the user to fill in more required data and to give consents acceptions. Either by accepting conditions, filling in data, adding pins etc. The precise flows of each plugin are out of scope. But the plug-in system must establish a frame, which allows the communication to the PCM mobile and provides basic tools like "Request Additional Data" or "Accept Conditions" or similar.</p>
<p><strong>The Mediator (Relay) layer</strong> is represented by the Mediator/Relay component which effectively provides notification management and therefore dispatches the externally received notifications for connection establishment to the respective cPCM where it is applicable.</p>

Main goal of this requirement is to keep the operational costs as low as possible.  </p>

<p>The product MUST implement the form factor "Browser-based application/addon for stationary PCs and notebooks", so that the cPCM can be used as a full-featured browser-based application that implements the GUI functionalities, the connectivity functionalities and credential and personal wallet management locally on the user's PC/notebook. The backup/restore mechanisms and the configuration management are handled as well locally on the user's PC/notebook.</p>
<p>Because PCs/Notebooks do not usually have a fixed communication endpoint an SSI-Mediator needs to remain in the Cloud for PCM Notifications.</p>
